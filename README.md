# pokedexcli

pokedexcli is a Pokedex in a command-line [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). We'll use the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to power all of the data we'll need. If you're not familiar with Pokemon, or a Pokedex, that's okay! A Pokedex is just a make-believe device that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats.
